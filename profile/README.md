### SIH25031 – Crowdsourced Civic Issue Reporting & Resolution System  

---

## 🌍 About the Project  
Local governments face difficulties in quickly identifying and fixing civic problems such as potholes, faulty streetlights, and overflowing garbage. Citizens notice these issues daily, but traditional reporting methods are inefficient and opaque.  

**Netrah** is building a **mobile-first, citizen-powered platform** to solve this.  
With our system, anyone can:  
- 📸 Capture and submit civic issues with photos/videos.  
- 📍 Share automatic location tags (GPS + cell tower).  
- 📝 Add quick text or voice notes.  
- 🔔 Track progress at every stage (confirmation → acknowledgment → resolution).  

Municipal staff gain a **centralized, AI-assisted dashboard** for categorizing, prioritizing, and resolving reports.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Empower citizens with **easy reporting tools**.  
- Help municipalities **prioritize and act faster**.
